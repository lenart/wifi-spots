# Fill here the Google Maps API keys for your application
# In this sample:
# - For development and test, we have only one possible host (localhost:3000), so there is only a single key associated with the mode.
# - In production, the app can be accessed through 2 different hosts:
#   thepochisuperstarmegashow.com and exmaple.com. There then needs a 2-key hash. If you deployed to one host, only the API key would be needed (as in development and test).
