module FriendlyId

  # This class is not intended to be used on its own, it is used internally
  # by `has_friendly_id` to store a model's configuration and
  # configuration-related methods.
  #
  # The arguments accepted by +has_friendly_id+ correspond to the writeable
  # instance attributes of this class; please see the description of the
  # attributes below for information on the possible options.
  #
  # @example
  # has_friendly_id :name,
  #  :use_slug => true,
  #  :max_length => 150,
  #  :approximate_ascii => true,
  #  :ascii_approximation_options => :german,
  #  :sequence_separator => ":",
  #  :reserved_words => ["reserved", "words"],
  #  :scope => :country,
  #  :cache_column => :my_cache_column_name
  #  # etc.
